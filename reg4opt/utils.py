#%% DATA GENERATION FOR REGRESSION METHODS

def sample_training_points(x, num_data, method="normal", **kwargs):
    """
    Sample training points.
    
    The function encapsulates different methods of generating the training 
    points for a regression problem. The choices are
    
    * normal: the data are chosen as :math:`x + d_i`, where
      :math:`d_i` are random vectors with normal distribution (by default the 
      variance is 0.01);
    * fireworks: the data are chosen as :math:`x + d_i`, where we have
      :math:`d_i = a e_j`, with :math:`a` a r.v. with normal distribution (with
      default variance 0.01) and :math:`e_j` a randomly selected vector of the 
      standard basis;
    * uniform: the data are chosen as :math:`x + d_i`, where
      :math:`d_i` are random vectors with uniform distribution in [-a, a] (by 
      default a = 1).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ndarray
        The center of the training data, that is, all other training points are
        chosen as perturbations of `x`.
    num_data : int

        `num_data`-1 points are randomly selected.
    method : str, optional
        The method to choose the training points, defaults to "normal". 
        Alternatives are "fireworks" (alias "fw", "f") and "uniform" (alias "u").
    **kwargs : tuple

def random_intersecting_balls(n, d, max_radius=100):

    Randomly generate a set of intersecting ball sets.
    
    This utility function generates a set of `d` balls in :math:`\mathbb{R}^n`
    for the purpose of testing projection methods. The centers of the balls are
    uniformly chosen points in the unit sphere, and the radius is randomly 
    picked between 0 (excluded) and `max_radius`.
    
    As a consequence, the origin of :math:`\mathbb{R}^n` is (one of the) points
    in the intersection of the balls.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The dimension of the space.
    d : int
        The number of balls to be generated.
    max_radius : float, optional
        The maximum radius of the generated balls. The default is 100.
