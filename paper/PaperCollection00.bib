  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we analyze algorithmic and architectural characteristics of a class of particle filters known as Gaussian Particle Filters ({GPFs}). {GPFs} approximate the posterior density of the unknowns with a Gaussian distribution which limits the scope of their applications in comparison with the universally applied sample-importance resampling filters ({SIRFs}) but allows for their implementation without the classical resampling procedure. Since there is no need for resampling, we propose a modified {GPF} algorithm that is suitable for parallel hardware realization. Based on the new algorithm, we propose an efficient parallel and pipelined architecture for {GPF} that is superior to similar architectures for {SIRF} in the sense that it requires no memories for storing particles and it has very low amount of data exchange through the communication network. We analyze the {GPF} on the bearings-only tracking problem and the results are compared with results obtained by {SIRF} in terms of computational complexity, potential throughput, and hardware energy. We consider implementation on {FPGAs} and we perform detailed comparison of the {GPF} and {SIRF} algorithms implemented in different ways on this platform. {GPFs} that are implemented in parallel pipelined fashion on {FPGAs} can support higher sampling rates than {SIRFs} and as such they might be a more suitable candidate for real-time applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Basic uniform pseudo-random number generators are implemented on {ATI} Graphics Processing Units ({GPU}). The performance results of the realized generators (multiplicative linear congruential ({GGL}), {XOR}-shift ({XOR128}), {RANECU}, {RANMAR}, {RANLUX} and Mersenne Twister ({MT19937})) on {CPU} and {GPU} are discussed. The obtained speed up factor is hundreds of times in comparison with {CPU}. {RANLUX} generator is found to be the most appropriate for using on {GPU} in Monte Carlo simulations. The brief review of the pseudo-random number generators used in modern software packages for Monte Carlo simulations in high-energy physics is presented.},

  Abstract                 = {In this article, we present an overview of methods for sequential simulation from posterior distributions. These methods are of particular interest in Bayesian filtering for discrete time dynamic models that are typically nonlinear and {non-Gaussian}. A general importance sampling framework is developed that unifies many of the methods which have been proposed over the last few decades in several different scientific disciplines. Novel extensions to the existing methods are also proposed. We show in particular how to incorporate local linearisation methods similar to those which have previously been employed in the deterministic filtering literature; these lead to very effective importance distributions. Furthermore we describe a method which uses {Rao-Blackwellisation} in order to take advantage of the analytic structure present in some important classes of state-space models. In a final section we develop algorithms for prediction, smoothing and evaluation of the likelihood in dynamic models.},

  Abstract                 = {Very high-speed computers may be classified as follows: 1) Single Instruction {Stream-Single} Data Stream ({SISD}) 2) Single Instruction {Stream-Multiple} Data Stream ({SIMD}) 3) Multiple Instruction {Stream-Single} Data Stream ({MISD}) 4) Multiple Instruction {Stream-Multiple} Data Stream ({MIMD}). "Stream," as used here, refers to the sequence of data or instructions as seen by the machine during the execution of a program. The constituents of a system: storage, execution, and instruction handling (branching) are discussed with regard to recent developments and/or systems limitations. The constituents are discussed in terms of concurrent {SISD} systems ({CDC} 6600 series and, in particular, {IBM} Model 90 series), since multiple stream organizations usually do not require any more elaborate components. Representative organizations are selected from each class and the arrangement of the constituents is shown.},

  Abstract                 = {Sequential Bayesian estimation for nonlinear dynamic state-space models involves recursive estimation of filtering and predictive distributions of unobserved time varying signals based on noisy observations. This paper introduces a new filter called the Gaussian particle filter. It is based on the particle filtering concept, and it approximates the posterior distributions by single Gaussians, similar to Gaussian filters like the extended Kalman filter and its variants. It is shown that under the Gaussianity assumption, the Gaussian particle filter is asymptotically optimal in the number of particles and, hence, has much-improved performance and versatility over other Gaussian filters, especially when nontrivial nonlinearities are present. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the versatility and improved performance of the Gaussian particle filter over conventional Gaussian filters and the lower complexity than known particle filters.},

  Abstract                 = {Four different parallel particle filters such as globally distributed particle filter ({GDPF}), resampling with proportional allocation filter ({RPA}), resampling with non-proportional allocation filter ({RNA}) and the Gaussian particle filter ({GPF}), are studied in terms of speedup and tracking accuracy in a bearings-only tracking problem. The filters are implemented on a shared memory multicore computer, where the speedup is measured using up to eight cores. The tracking accuracy is studied in a simulated {BOT} application where the {GPF} exhibits best tracking accuracy, and {RNA}, {RPA} and {GDPF} give tracking accuracy comparable to the sequential particle filter. Both {GPF} and {RNA} appear to be capable of achieving linear speedup in the number of cores used, while {RPA} shows somewhat less encouraging speedup and {GDPF} is found to have a speedup limited to about 3 times.},

Each generator uses shared memory on graphic processors asits internal state space, and uses constant memory as a look-up table for alinear transformation. Output formats of the generator are 32-bit integers andsingle precision floating point numbers obeying the {IEEE} 754 format. A 64-bitinteger version and double precision floating point version are also {available.The} author also proposes a parameter generator for these generators. Theparameter generator provides us with independent streams of pseudorandomnumbers, which can be generated in parallel.},

  Abstract                 = {Graphics processors ({GPU}) offer the promise of more than an order of magnitude speedup over conventional processors for certain non-graphics computations. Because the {GPU} is often presented as a C-like abstraction (e.g., Nvidia's {CUDA}), little is known about the characteristics of the {GPU}'s architecture beyond what the manufacturer has documented. This work develops a microbechmark suite and measures the {CUDA}-visible architectural characteristics of the Nvidia {GT200} ({GTX280}) {GPU}. Various undisclosed characteristics of the processing elements and the memory hierarchies are measured. This analysis exposes undocumented features that impact program performance and correctness. These measurements can be useful for improving performance optimization, analysis, and modeling on this architecture and offer additional insight on the decisions made in developing this {GPU}.},

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with the study of bidirectionally coupled platoon systems. The case considered is when the vehicles are heterogeneous and the coupling can be nonlinear and asymmetric. For such systems, a sufficient condition for L∞ string stability is presented. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated via a numerical example, where it is shown how our result can be recast as an optimization problem, allowing to design the control protocol for each vehicle independently on the other vehicles and hence leading to a bottom-up approach for the design of string stable systems able to track a time-varying reference speed.},
